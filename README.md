We still do not know a lot in AngularJS so we have not yet sent the data to the front end

We also do not know yet how sessions work in passport so we are not sure that it is req.session.data like we did in the mini project

We did not finish the main page view yet and have not begun in the other

The functions were tested using postman and by passing the object ids of previously inserted data the did not require an id of another object
